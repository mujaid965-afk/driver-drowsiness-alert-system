# Driver Drowsiness Alert System

This is a mini project developed as part of my Electronics and Communication Engineering curriculum.

## Project Description
The system detects driver drowsiness by monitoring eye-blink patterns using a camera.
When signs of fatigue are detected, an alert is triggered to warn the driver.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- Dlib (if used)
- Arduino (alert interface – conceptual)

## Project Status
Academic mini project.
Currently documented with report and software implementation.

## Files Included
- Complete project report (PDF)
- Source code used for drowsiness detection
- System block diagram and flowchart

## Future Improvements
- Real-time hardware integration
- Buzzer or vibration-based alert system
- Embedded platform deployment
